## Welcome to the AIRR Minimal Standards Working Group

### Introduction

The Minimal Standards Working Group has created experimental metadata standards to describe how AIRR-Seq data are generated and evaluated for quality. These metadata include clinical and demographic data on the subjects, sample information, cell phenotypes, nucleic acid purification, immune receptor amplification, sequencing library preparation, sequencing protocol, deposition of the raw sequencing data, and documentation of the computational pipelines used to generate the processed data. A Guidelines Manuscript is being prepared that outlines the set of metadata recommended for submission of AIRR-Seq data for publication or curation in an AIRR-compliant public data repository.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
