_Minimum information about an Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire Sequencing Experiment_

***

### Introduction
One of the primary initiatives of the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) Community has been to develop a set of
metadata standards for the submission of AIRR sequencing datasets. This work has been carried out by the AIRR Community
Minimal Standards Working Group](http://airr.irmacs.sfu.ca/working_groups/minimal_standards). In order to support
reproducibility, standard quality control, and data deposition in a common repository, the AIRR Community has agreed to
six high-level data sets that will guide the publication, curation and sharing of AIRR-Seq data and metadata: Study and
subject, sample collection, sample processing and sequencing, raw sequences, processing of sequence data, and processed
AIRR sequences. The detailed data elements within these sets are defined
[here](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/master/AIRR_Minimal_Standard_Data_Elements.tsv).

### Implementations

- [NCBI-based](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/tree/master/NCBI_implementation)
- AIRR Common Repositories - _in development_
