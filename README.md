## Welcome to the AIRR Minimal Standards Working Group

### Introduction

The Minimal Standards Working Group has created experimental metadata standards to describe how AIRR-Seq data are generated and evaluated for quality. These metadata include clinical and demographic data on the subjects, sample information, cell phenotypes, nucleic acid purification, immune receptor amplification, sequencing library preparation, sequencing protocol, deposition of the raw sequencing data, and documentation of the computational pipelines used to generate the processed data. A Guidelines Manuscript is being prepared that outlines the set of metadata recommended for submission of AIRR-Seq data for publication or curation in an AIRR-compliant public data repository.

### AIRR data submission to BioProject, BioSample and SRA

<hr>

Submitting AIRR data and associated metadata to the Bioproject, BioSample and SRA databases via NCBI's web interface follows in general the submission procedure described in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47529/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK47529.pdf, but uses AIRR-specific template for metadata submission:

	- Go to \url{https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/sra/} and login with your NCBI account (create an account if necessary).
	- Click on "create new submission". You will see a form as below. Fill the form with required information and click on "continue".

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
