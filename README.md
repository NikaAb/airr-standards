<i>Revolutizing the Immune Receptor Sequencing through Standardization</i>

***


### Introduction

The AIRR Community has defined six high-level sets that will guide the publication, curation and sharing of AIRR-Seq data and metadata: Study and subject, sample collection, sample processing and sequencing, raw sequences, processing of sequence data, and processed AIRR sequences. The detailed data elements within these sets are defined  <a href="https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/master/AIRR_Minimal_Standard_Data_Elements.csv">here </a>. An implementation of the AIRR data standard has been developed for the NCBI repositories (BioProject, BioSample, Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and GenBank). The association between each of these repositories and the AIRR sets is shown below:

This site provides a guide for submission of AIRR sequencing data and metadata to NCBI public data repositories.

The process consists of 4 sequential steps:

###  <i>1- Submit study and sample-level information to NCBI BioProject and BioSample repositories</i>
###  <i>2- Submit raw sequencing data to NCBI SRA using the <a href="https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/tree/master/NCBI%20Templates">AIRR data templates</a></i>
###  <i>3- Generate a DOI for the protocol describing how raw sequencing data were processed using  Zenodo (https://zenodo.org)  or equivalent</i>
###  <i>4- Submit processed sequencing data with sequence-level annotations to GenBank using AIRR feature tags</i>

For step-by-step instructions on carrying out theses steps an AIRR study submission, please <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tytddwptgkhb#/41759617/">Click here to view</a>
