Data Submission Guides
------------------------------

There are multiple data repositories that accept submission of AIRR-seq datasets.
Each provides different capabilities but all comply with the MiAIRR standard.

Data Query and Download
-----------------------

Submission of AIRR-seq datasets to public data repositories means that other
researchers can query, download and reuse that data for novel analyses.

AIRR Data Commons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These data repositories all implement the AIRR Data Commons (ADC) API programmatic access to
query and download AIRR-seq data.

+ VDJServer Community Data Portal

Other Public Data Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are additional data repositories that provide access to AIRR-seq data but which
did not implement the ADC API for programmatic access. Information about some of these
repositories are provided in a `B-T.CR forum post`_.
